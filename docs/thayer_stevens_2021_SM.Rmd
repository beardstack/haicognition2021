(ref:affect1-cap) Post-condition predicted affect scores (controlling for pre-condition scores) for control and HAI (human-animal interaction) groups in Experiment 1. Scores show (a) positive PANAS ratings and (b) negative PANAS ratings. Negative affect scores are log-transformed. Open triangles (blue) represent individual control participant scores, open circles (orange) represent individual HAI participant scores, closed triangles and circles represent condition group means (with lines connecting condition means), error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.

(ref:cognitive1-cap) Post-condition predicted cognitive scores (controlling for pre-condition scores) for HAI (human-animal interaction) and control groups in Experiment 1. Scores show (a) the difference in number of attentional shifts between the two Necker cube trials, (b) the index for the backwards digit span task, and (c) $d'$ for the n-back task. Open triangles (blue) represent individual control participant scores, open circles (orange) represent individual HAI participant scores, closed triangles and circles represent condition group means (with lines connecting condition means), error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.
